## Data Queries
I have provided some pre-defined queries (which return a JSON document) with the most helpful information set up and 
later I will explain how
 to 
create your own queries with custom filters, only specific data, etc. 
#### Pre-Defined Queries
1. Total World Confirmed Cases, World Deaths, and World Recovered Cases
    - URL: [World Data](https://services1.arcgis.com/0MSEUqKaxRlEPj5g/ArcGIS/rest/services/Coronavirus_2019_nCoV_Cases/FeatureServer/1/query?where=1=1&outStatistics=[{"statisticType":"sum","onStatisticField":"Confirmed","outStatisticFieldName":"confirmed"},{"statisticType":"sum","onStatisticField":"deaths","outStatisticFieldName":"deaths"},{"statisticType":"sum","onStatisticField":"recovered","outStatisticFieldName":"recovered"}]&f=pjson) *(Use this in your program to get the JSON Document)*
    - This will return a JSON Document with the Total World Confirmed Cases, World Deaths, and World Recovered Cases, 
    which should look like this *(data will differ of course)*:
